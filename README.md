## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.

The page will reload if you make edits.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

All of that will be packed into a installer (this can change based on your OS).

### `yarn lint`

Tells the linter (`eslint`) to find errors in your code.

### `yarn lint:fix`

Tells the linter (`eslint`) to find errors in your code. And fix all auto-fixable problems.
